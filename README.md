S&amp;P Sector ETF Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest - MSc Dissertation Project

This project compares financial performance metrics for holding US Sector Exchange-Traded-Funds (ETFs) after detecting real-time anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm over the period 2012-2022. A combination of fundamental and technical data is used to construct the feature set. On average, in most sectors, returns, volatility and risk-adjusted returns all increased following the detection of an anomaly.
